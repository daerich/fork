SYNOPSIS
       fork [-qd] [PROGRAM] [ARGS..]

DESCRIPTION
       fork runs a programm after a fork(2), optionally detaching from the
       shell's session.  If specified standard I/O streams will be closed as
       well.  Its primary use is as a more committed subshell('&') for
       standalone programs.

OPTIONS
              -q Quiet the programs output, effectively closing its I/O
              streams.

              -d Detach from controlling terminal, completely "daemonizing"
              the to be started program.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns 0 on sucess, 1 otherwise.

NOTES
       Spawning a process in the same session as the controlling shell might
       cause problems with it when receiving SIGTTN . Please consult your
       shell's manual for further information.
